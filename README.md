# Simple Auction with Blockchain

## Overview

Run testrpc or ganache-cli locally to run the testchain. 

Steps:

1. An html file which contains the UI, Bytecode and ABI.
2. Install ganache-cli (eg: npm install ganache-cli ).
	a. ganache-cli  (After you have run this, you should have a Test Chain Running which serves on port 8545).
3. Goto your Solidity IDE REMEX (http://remix.ethereum.org/)
	a. Connect to web3 (REMIX -> RUN -> Web3 connector using REMIX IDE Chrome browser) to the ganache-cli running on port 8545
4. Now you can develop Smart Contracts in this Remix Compiler with all its feature while having our local Ethereum Chain running.
5. Amend html file with ByteCode and AMI (you can get the bytecode and API and paste it into your html file).
